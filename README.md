# TicTacToeCaptcha
This project is a work in progress. A web captcha in the form of a TicTacToe game vs computer. For this project I had to teach myself C#, then .NET web forms and finally some AI (I implemented the MiniMax algorithm). 

Here you can see the web during a game (where the player is a cow and the computer is a tomatto) :
